## How It Works

1. Choose a chit plan – pick the value and duration that fits your goal.  
2. Pay monthly installments – contribute a fixed amount each month.  
3. Participate in auctions – bid when you need the money earlier.  
4. Receive the prize amount – get funds while continuing to pay your remaining installments.
