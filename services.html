    <!-- ================= HOW OUR SERVICES WORK ================= -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <div class="about-wrapper" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr; text-align: center;">

        <div class="about-text">
          <h2>How Our Services Work</h2>
          <p>
            Our chit fund services follow a simple, structured, and transparent process
            designed to make participation easy and stress-free for all members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Members begin by selecting a chit plan that aligns with their financial
            objectives. A fixed monthly contribution is made for the duration of
            the chit, promoting consistent and disciplined savings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each month, a transparent auction is conducted where one member receives
            the chit amount. Over the full tenure, every participant receives the
            lump-sum amount once, making chit funds a reliable method for both saving
            and planned borrowing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This well-defined process ensures fairness, flexibility, and financial
            stability for all our members.
